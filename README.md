# Project Title: Statistical Learning with Applications in Python

## Overview
This repository contains Python code and Jupyter Notebook files developed as part of a study project based on the book *"An Introduction to Statistical Learning, With Applications in Python (ISLP)"* authored *Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani,* and *Jonathan Taylor*. The content of this repository is intended to supplement and enhance the understanding of the concepts presented in the book through practical implementation and experimentation.

The Jupyter Notebook files included here are adapted from the resources provided on the book’s official website. These adaptations aim to explore and apply the concepts discussed in the book, offering engaged experience with the material.

## Project Description
In this project, we have taken the original `.ipynb` files from the book's resources and modified them to include abbreviated explanations, code enhancements, and practical examples. The goal is to provide a more extensive understanding of the topics covered.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to *Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani,* and *Jonathan Taylor* for their insightful work on "*An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in Python.*" Their contributions to the field of Statistical Learning have been invaluable and have significantly enriched our learning experience.

Additionally, I am also grateful to my friend Tanvir Alam (https://github.com/Tanviralam007), whose enthusiasm and collaboration made this study project both delightful and productive. Working together as a team has greatly improved our understanding of the book's concepts, and I deeply appreciate the opportunity to learn alongside him.

## Ethical Considerations
The work presented in this repository is an educational adaptation of the resources provided by the book and its authors. We have taken care to ensure that our modifications are transformative and add value beyond the original materials. All code and content have been created to refine our understanding of the book’s concepts, and appropriate credit is given to the original authors and their work.

If you have any inquiry or concerns regarding the use of these materials, please feel free to reach out.
